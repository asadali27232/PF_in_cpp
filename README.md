# PF_in_cpp
I am uploading all the LAB tasks of course Programming Fundamentals by Sir Aksam Iftikhar to help my fallows. I also have a Github Page for this purpose so that you can access and interact graphically with all these tasks and get help out of it. My purpose in uploading this here is to make you understand the use of basic concept of Programming Fundamentals. I hope so it will be beneficial for you in a positive way.


Have a look!


Thank You!
